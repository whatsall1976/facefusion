This fork added two scripts:
./filter_video.py
./facefusion/frame_filter.py

And the usage is:

python filter_video.py --reference 1.jpg --target test.mp4 --output output.mp4 --face-detector-score 0.5 --horizontal-threshold 0.7 --vertical-threshold 0.2 --occlusion-threshold 0.92

you can adjust the values of --face-detector-score, --horizontal-threshold, --vertical-threshold, --occlusion-threshold to fit your needs.
occlusion threshold is the score of less occlusion, the higher the score, the less occlusion. It adds a penalty to the score from eyes, nose, and lips and use 1 minus the sum to obtain the final score.
